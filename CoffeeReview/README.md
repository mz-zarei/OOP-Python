# Project Description

The goal is to build a journal to rate different coffees. The journal will use **encapsulation**. Users enter the name of the roaster, the country of origin, the region and how many stars (*) they rate the coffee. Entries are saved to a CSV file. Users can display coffees already in the journal, or they can add new coffees to the journal. There are two main parts to this project, the <CoffeeJournal> class and the command line interface.
