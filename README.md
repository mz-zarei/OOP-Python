# Object Oriented Programming Projects with Python

- Coffee review journal (Encapsulation)
  - The goal is to build a journal to rate different coffees. The journal will use encapsulation. Users enter the name of the roaster, the country of origin, the region and how many stars (*) they rate the coffee. Entries are saved to a CSV file. Users can display coffees already in the journal, or they can add new coffees to the journal. There are two main parts to this project, the class and the command line interface.
