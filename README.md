# Object Oriented Programming Projects with Python

- Coffee review journal (Encapsulation)
  - The goal is to build a journal to rate different coffees. The journal will use encapsulation. Users enter the name of the roaster, the country of origin, the region and how many stars (*) they rate the coffee. Entries are saved to a CSV file. Users can display coffees already in the journal, or they can add new coffees to the journal. There are two main parts to this project, the class and the command line interface.
  
- Contact List (Polymorphism)
  - This mini project will focus on using polymorphism while interacting with a contact list. There is a main class that controls the “view” the user sees and responds to user input. The contact information (personal and work) is an instance of the class.
  
- BlackJack Game
  - In this mini project a clone of the game Flappy Bird is created that makes use of the topics covered in this module.
